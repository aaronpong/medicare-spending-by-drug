# Medicare Part D Drug Spending Dashboard (2024)

An end-to-end data analysis project using CMS Medicare Part D public data to explore drug spending trends, top manufacturers, specialty drug costs, and year-over-year comparisons. Data was loaded into PostgreSQL, queried with SQL, and visualized in an interactive Tableau Public dashboard.

## Project Overview

Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs for millions of Americans. This project analyzes CMS spending data to identify which drugs and manufacturers account for the largest share of Medicare spending, highlight high-cost specialty drugs for rare diseases, and track spending trends across 2024 and 2025.

## SQL Analysis

Four analytical queries were built to drive the dashboard:

**1. Top 10 Drugs by Total Spending**
Filters to "Overall" manufacturer rows to avoid double-counting and ranks drugs by total Medicare spending in 2024.

**2. Top 10 Manufacturers by Total Spending**
Aggregates spending at the manufacturer level, excluding overall rollup rows, to identify which companies receive the most Medicare reimbursement.

**3. High-Cost Specialty Drugs**
Identifies drugs with the highest average spending per beneficiary — revealing ultra-rare disease treatments that cost over $600K per patient annually despite serving very small patient populations.

**4. Year-Over-Year Comparison**
Compares total spending for the top 5 drugs between 2024 (full year) and 2025 (Q1-Q3 partial year) to identify spending trajectory.

## Key Findings

- **Eliquis (Apixaban)** was the highest-spending Medicare drug in 2024, driven by high claim volume across a large beneficiary population
- **BMS Primarycare** led all manufacturers in total Medicare reimbursement
- **Exondys-51**, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment, had the highest cost per beneficiary at over $1.4M annually — serving only 18 Medicare patients
- Several top drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro show 2025 spending already trending toward or exceeding their 2024 totals despite being partial-year data
